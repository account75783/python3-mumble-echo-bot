# Python3 Echo Bot

This is a simple Python3 echo bot written by **ChatGPT**.

## Features
- The bot will echo back any message it hears in real-time.
- You must specify the correct IP, port, name, and channel.
- For minimal latency, it's best to run the bot on the same server as Mumble. Use `localhost` if this is the case.

## Configuration
Be sure to set:
- **IP Address**
- **Port**
- **Bot Name**
- **Channel**

Feel free to do whatever you want this this code.

## Future improvement ideas?
Announce the user's packetloss, ping and connection type. pymumble doesn't support gathering this data unfortunatly, at least not yet.
